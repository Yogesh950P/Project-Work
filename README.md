The Report_masters_thesis pdf is report of my M.Sc. thesis titled "Phase shift analysis of pâˆ’ 16O elastic scattering at Astrophysical Energies using phase function method" 
done under the guidance of Prof. O.S.K.S. Sastri, Central University of Himachal Pradesh. (https://www.cuhimachal.ac.in/admin/assets/uploads/faculty/202211241138135c79641eb8.pdf)
In this work, we have obtained model parameters for S- wave using scattering phase shift for elastic scattering of P16O for laboratory energies up to 2.5 MeV. The nuclear part of the interaction is defined by the Morse potential, and the electromagnetic part by the Atomic Hulthen potential, in order to characterise the nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering . Phase shift calculations for 2S1/2 of P16O have been performed using the phase function approach, and model parameters are optimized by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the experimental data and the computed scattering phase shifts. The simulated phase shifts for 2S1/2 are found to be in good agreement with the expected phase shifts, with MSE of 0.47 is achieved for the model parameters.
