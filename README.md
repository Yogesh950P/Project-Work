The Report_masters_thesis.pdf is a report of my M.Sc. thesis titled "Phase shift analysis of p-16O elastic scattering at Astrophysical Energies using phase function method" done under the guidance of Prof. O.S.K.S. Sastri, Central University of Himachal Pradesh. (https://www.cuhimachal.ac.in/admin/assets/uploads/faculty/202211241138135c79641eb8.pdf).
In this work, we have obtained model parameters for S-wave using scattering phase shift for elastic scattering of P16O for laboratory energies up to 2.5 MeV. The nuclear part of the interaction is defined by the Morse potential, and the electromagnetic part by the Atomic Hulthen potential, to characterise the nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering. Phase shift calculations for 2S1/2 of P16O have been performed using the phase function approach, and model parameters are optimized by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the experimental data and the computed scattering phase shifts. The simulated phase shifts for 2S1/2 are found to be in good agreement with the expected phase shifts, with an MSE of 0.47 achieved for the model parameters.



The Cluster_Formation_Model.pdf is a paper titled "Alpha preformation probability from Cluster Formation Model using AME-2020" which is also done under the guidance of Prof. O.S.K.S. Sastri, Central University of Himachal Pradesh.In this work, we examined the alpha-cluster preformation factors for the actinide region to confirm the relative longevity of odd N nuclei compared to their even N neighbors using experimental BEs from the atomic mass evaluation in AME2020.
